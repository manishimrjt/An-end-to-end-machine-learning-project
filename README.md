# An-end-to-end-machine-learning-project
Predicting how many medals each country will win in the olympics using a linear regression model. This includes creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error.

Machine learning project steps

Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which we'll also follow here.  This outline will help you tackle any machine learning problem.

**Project Steps**

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.

* `data_prep.ipynb` - the code to generate the team-level dataset from an athlete-level dataset
